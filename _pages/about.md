Hi. I am <span id="name">Lingyi Hu</span>, a physics undergraduate student at Imperial College London. 

When I'm not investigating the secrets of the universe (read: doing problem sheets), I'm usually [writing](https://writing.theconfused.me) or [coding](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}). Or sleeping. 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/lingxz/) or say hello at <mailto:me@hulingyi.com>.
