I am a physics undergraduate student at Imperial College London. This is a tech/physics blog where I make sense of my extended mind, and hopefully contribute to someone else's. 

I also keep a [creative writing blog](https://writing.theconfused.me), which holds poetry, essays, and fiction I've written over the years. 

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/lingxz/) or say hello at <mailto:lingyihuu@gmail.com>.
