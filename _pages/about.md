Hi. I am <span id="name">Lingyi Hu</span>, a physics undergraduate student at Imperial College London. When I'm not investigating the secrets of the universe (read: doing problem sheets), I'm usually writing or coding. Or sleeping. 

This is my corner of the internet where I share my writing on physics and coding. The title of this site came about because the journey to learning physics and coding has not been without bumps in the road. 

I also keep a [creative writing blog](https://writing.theconfused.me), which holds poetry, essays, and fiction I've written over the years. 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/lingxz/) or say hello at <mailto:me@hulingyi.com>.
