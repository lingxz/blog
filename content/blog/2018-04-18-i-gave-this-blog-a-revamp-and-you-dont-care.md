title: I gave this blog a revamp, and you don't care

In the process of switching to a new theme, I stripped out most of the bloat I once painstakingly added: search, comments, related posts, gulp pipeline. <!--more-->

I feel like there is always a cycle. I find something new, fiddle with it, keep adding cool new functionality to it, and eventually I get tired of the bloat and revert to the minimalistic solution. 

And maybe someday I will get bored of this simple design and start adding things to it again. So if the version you see has any of those things listed above, you'd know that the cycle has begun once more.
